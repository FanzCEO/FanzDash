# FanzDash - FANZ Ecosystem

## Overview

FanzDash serves as the central command center for the FANZ Unlimited Network LLC creator economy ecosystem. It's a comprehensive adult content platform management system that orchestrates multiple specialized platforms (BoyFanz, GirlFanz, PupFanz, TransFanz, TabooFanz, FanzTube, FanzCock) under a unified technical infrastructure.

The application is built as a modern full-stack TypeScript/React application with Express backend, designed to handle enterprise-scale operations including payment processing, content management, creator payouts, compliance monitoring, and cross-platform user management. The system emphasizes creator autonomy, maximum earnings potential, and robust security/compliance measures specifically tailored for the adult content industry.

## Recent Changes

### October 7, 2025 - Build Fixes for Deployment
- Fixed missing `contentModerationService` dependency in `mlInferencePipeline.ts` by using the existing `aiContentModerationService` from `server/aiContentModeration.ts`
- Replaced unsafe `eval()` usage in `vrRenderingEngine.ts` with safe frame rate parsing (handles formats like "30/1" and "24000/1001")
- Replaced unsafe `eval()` usage in `contentProcessor.ts` with safe frame rate parsing
- Set Express `trust proxy` setting to `1` for proper rate limiting in production behind reverse proxy
- Commented out `QuantumWarRoom` 3D visualization feature (temporarily disabled due to React Three.js compatibility with React 18)
