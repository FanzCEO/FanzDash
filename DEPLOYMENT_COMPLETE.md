## ⚠️ Critical Issue: IPv6 Connection

**Problem:** Render does not support IPv6, but Supabase's direct connection uses IPv6 only.

**Error:**
```
Error: connect ENETUNREACH 2600:1f18:2e13:9d2a:a257:528:d1b3:7d2f:5432
```

**Why:** The `NODE_OPTIONS=--dns-result-order=ipv4first` workaround doesn't work because `pg` uses `libpq` which has its own DNS resolution.

## 🔧 How to Fix (2 Minutes)

### Enable Supabase IPv4 Add-On

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard:**
   https://eglawbjqtbsofofdqfzr.supabase.co

2. **Go to Settings → Add-ons**

3. **Enable "Dedicated IPv4 Address"**
   - Cost: $2/month
   - Wait ~1 minute for provisioning

4. **Update Render Environment:**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d426qg3ipnbc73c3fea0
   - Settings → Environment
   - Get new `DATABASE_URL` from Supabase Settings → Database
   - **Remove** `NODE_OPTIONS` variable
   - Render will auto-redeploy

5. **Test:**
   ```bash
   curl https://fanzdash.onrender.com/api/dashboard/stats
   ```
   Should return real database stats instead of error.
