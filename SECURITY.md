# Security Policy

## 🔒 Our Commitment to Security

At FANZ, security is not just a feature—it's the foundation of our creator-first ecosystem. We implement enterprise-grade security measures to protect creators, fans, and the entire platform.

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Framework
- **No default trust** - Every request is authenticated and authorized
- **Least privilege access** - Minimum required permissions only
- **Network segmentation** - Isolated microservices with secure communication
- **Identity verification** - Multi-factor authentication required

### Encryption Standards
- **TLS 1.3** for all data in transit
- **AES-256** for data at rest
- **End-to-end encryption** for sensitive creator content
- **Perfect forward secrecy** - Compromised keys don't affect past sessions

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container security** - Distroless images, non-root execution
- **Kubernetes hardening** - Network policies, RBAC, admission controllers
- **CDN protection** - DDoS mitigation, WAF rules
- **Database encryption** - Transparent data encryption (TDE)

## 🚨 Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | ✅ Active Support  |
| 1.9.x   | ✅ Security Updates |
| 1.8.x   | ⚠️ Legacy Support  |
| < 1.8   | ❌ End of Life     |
