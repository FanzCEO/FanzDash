## Color Theory & Algorithms

### Q: What color theory algorithms are available?

**A:** We provide 5 professional algorithms:

- **Complementary**: High contrast, vibrant designs
- **Triadic**: Balanced, dynamic color schemes
- **Analogous**: Harmonious, peaceful designs
- **Monochromatic**: Cohesive, sophisticated looks
- **Split-Complementary**: Balanced high contrast

### Q: Which algorithm should I choose?

**A:** It depends on your goal:

- For call-to-action buttons: **Complementary**
- For professional interfaces: **Monochromatic**
- For creative, dynamic sites: **Triadic**
- For calm, branded experiences: **Analogous**
- For balanced contrast: **Split-Complementary**

### Q: Can I mix different algorithms?

**A:** While each generation uses one algorithm, you can manually adjust individual colors afterward, or generate different sections with different algorithms and combine the results.

## Accessibility Features

### Q: What accessibility standards does the tool follow?

**A:** The theme generator validates colors against WCAG 2.1 guidelines and provides real-time contrast ratio calculations with AAA, AA, and Large Text ratings.

### Q: What do the accessibility badges mean?

**A:**

- **🟢 AAA**: 7:1+ contrast ratio - highest accessibility standard
- **🟡 AA**: 4.5:1+ contrast ratio - standard accessibility compliance
- **🟠 AA Large**: 3:1+ contrast ratio - acceptable for large text only
- **🔴 Fail**: Below accessibility standards - needs improvement

### Q: How do I fix accessibility issues?

**A:** Focus on adjusting the **lightness** slider rather than hue or saturation. Make text colors darker on light backgrounds, or lighter on dark backgrounds, until you achieve at least an AA rating.

### Q: Are there legal requirements for accessibility?

**A:** Many jurisdictions require WCAG AA compliance for public websites. We recommend aiming for AA standards as a minimum, with AAA being ideal for maximum accessibility.

## Live Preview & Real-Time Features

### Q: How does Live Preview work?

**A:** Live Preview applies your color changes instantly across the entire Fanz™ interface by updating CSS variables in real-time. This lets you see exactly how your theme will look before saving.

### Q: Is Live Preview safe to use?

**A:** Yes! Live Preview only affects the visual appearance temporarily. Your changes aren't permanently saved until you explicitly save the theme.

### Q: Can other users see my Live Preview changes?

**A:** No, Live Preview changes only appear in your browser session. Other users won't see your experimental themes until you save and deploy them.

### Q: Why might Live Preview be slow?

**A:** Performance depends on your device and browser. If you experience lag, try:

- Closing unnecessary browser tabs
- Disabling other browser extensions temporarily
- Using a more powerful device
- Making changes with Live Preview disabled, then enabling it to see results

## Theme Management

### Q: Where are my saved themes stored?

**A:** Themes are saved locally in your browser's storage. They persist between sessions but are specific to the browser and device you're using.

### Q: Can I access my themes from different computers?

**A:** Saved themes are stored locally, so they won't automatically sync across devices. However, you can export themes as JSON files and import them on other devices.

### Q: How many themes can I save?

**A:** There's no hard limit, but browser storage has practical constraints. We recommend exporting important themes as backup files to avoid potential data loss.

### Q: Can I share themes with team members?

**A:** Yes! Export your theme as a JSON file and share it with team members. They can then import it or manually recreate the colors using the provided values.

---

## Export & Import Features

### Q: What format are exported themes?

**A:** Themes are exported as JSON files with all color definitions, metadata, and version information. This format is human-readable and compatible with other tools.

### Q: Can I edit exported theme files?

**A:** Yes! The JSON format is designed to be editable. You can modify color values directly in a text editor, though we recommend using the theme generator interface for most changes.

### Q: How do I import themes?

**A:** Currently, you can view exported theme files and manually enter the color values. Future versions may include automatic import functionality.

### Q: Can I use themes with other design tools?

**A:** The exported JSON includes both HSL and HEX values, making it compatible with most design software like Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, and other color management tools.

## Advanced Features

### Q: What's the difference between "Random Colors" and "Surprise Me"?

**A:**

- **Random Colors**: Generates random colors using your currently selected algorithm
- **Surprise Me**: Randomly selects both the algorithm AND generates new colors

### Q: Can I undo changes?

**A:** While there's no formal undo system, you can:

- Use the Reset button to return to default colors
- Save theme versions before making major changes
- Reload the page to start over (loses unsaved work)

### Q: How do I copy just one color?

**A:** Click the copy icon on any color card to copy it to your clipboard. The color is copied in HEX format by default.

## Performance & Technical

### Q: Does the theme generator affect site performance?

**A:** The theme generator itself only runs when you're actively using it. Applied themes use standard CSS variables, which have minimal performance impact on your live site.

**A:** The exported HSL and HEX values can be used in any design context, though the specific implementation may need adaptation for different platforms.

### Q: Are there any limitations?

**A:** Current limitations include:

- Themes stored locally (not synced across devices)
- Manual import process for shared themes
- Works best on modern browsers
- Some older devices may have performance limitations
