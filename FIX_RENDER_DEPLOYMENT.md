# 🔧 Fix Render Deployment Issue

## The Problem

The deployment is failing because `vite` is not found during the build process. This happens because:
- Render uses `npm install` which doesn't install dev dependencies by default
- `vite` and `esbuild` are in your `devDependencies`

## The Solution

You need to update the build command in the Render dashboard to install dev dependencies.

## 📝 Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard

Open: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d426qg3ipnbc73c3fea0

Or: Go to https://dashboard.render.com → Click on "FanzDash" service

### Step 2: Edit Environment Settings

Click: **"Environment"** (in the left sidebar)

### Step 3: Update Build Command

Find: **"Build Command"** field

Change from:
```
npm install && npm run build
```

Change to:
```
npm install --include=dev && npm run build
```

### Step 4: Save and Deploy

1. Click **"Save Changes"** at the bottom
2. Render will automatically trigger a new deployment
3. Wait ~5 minutes for the build to complete

## ✅ Verify

Once deployed successfully, test:

- **Main App:** https://fanzdash.onrender.com
- **Health Check:** https://fanzdash.onrender.com/healthz

## 🆘 If Still Failing

If the deployment still fails after this fix:

1. Check the build logs in Render dashboard
2. Look for any error messages
3. Share the logs with me and I'll help debug

**Note:** The `render.yaml` file in your repo is not automatically applied. You need to manually update settings in the dashboard or use the Render API. For now, updating the dashboard is the quickest fix.
