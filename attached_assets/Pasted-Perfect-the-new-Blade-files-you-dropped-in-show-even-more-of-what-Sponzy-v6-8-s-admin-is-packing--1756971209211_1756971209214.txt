üîë Implications for Polyglot Migration

These v6.8 additions expand the scope we need to map into services:
	1.	Tax ‚Üí commerce-svc
	‚Ä¢	Store rules in tax_rates.
	‚Ä¢	Apply at order level (ledger_entries).
	‚Ä¢	Emit order.tax_applied.
	2.	Advertising ‚Üí ads-svc (new)
	‚Ä¢	Separate service for ad campaigns.
	‚Ä¢	APIs for CRUD ads, approve/reject, track metrics.
	‚Ä¢	Events: ad.campaign.created, ad.impression.logged.
	3.	Announcements ‚Üí notifier-svc
	‚Ä¢	Broadcast channel with priority levels.
	‚Ä¢	Events: announcement.published.
	4.	Atlos ‚Üí moderation-svc adapter
	‚Ä¢	Wrap Atlos API for auto moderation.
	‚Ä¢	Pipe flagged events to moderation.actioned.
	5.	Audio Calls ‚Üí calls-svc (new)
	‚Ä¢	WebRTC signaling, per-minute billing.
	‚Ä¢	Events: call.started, call.ended, call.charged.
	6.	Bank/Billing/Processors (Binance, Cardinity) ‚Üí payout-svc + commerce-svc
	‚Ä¢	Expand allowlist beyond Stripe/PayPal (which we‚Äôre banning).
	‚Ä¢	ENV: BINANCE_API_KEY, CARDINITY_*.
	‚Ä¢	Events: payout.sent, crypto.txn.confirmed.
	7.	Blog ‚Üí cms-svc (new)
	‚Ä¢	CRUD pages, posts, categories.
	‚Ä¢	Admin-only editing.
	‚Ä¢	Events: blog.post.published.

‚∏ª

‚ö° Bottom line: BoyFanz‚Äôs current stack has gone far beyond the original Sponzy. Ads, crypto, taxes, calls, and announcements are already integrated ‚Äî so in the polyglot rebuild, we need to spin up at least three new microservices (ads-svc, calls-svc, cms-svc) and enrich commerce-svc, payout-svc, and moderation-svc with these extra integrations.

Do you want me to update the migration canvas doc now with these v6.8 modules slotted into the service map (ads, calls, tax, blog, Binance/Cardinity, announcements)? That way your Replit team sees exactly how these map into the polyglot architecture.
