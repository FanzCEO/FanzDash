üîë Polyglot Migration Mapping
	1.	Moderation (Images/Videos) ‚Üí moderation-svc
	‚Ä¢	Extend with video review, blur tools, takedowns.
	‚Ä¢	Events: media.flagged, media.removed.
	‚Ä¢	Should tie into ai-svc (vision classifiers).
	2.	Reserved Names ‚Üí users-svc
	‚Ä¢	Store reserved list in policy config.
	‚Ä¢	Enforced at signup/username change.
	3.	Payments (Mollie, NowPayments, OpenPix, Payku, Paystack) ‚Üí commerce-svc
	‚Ä¢	Extend allowlist with ENV keys:
	‚Ä¢	MOLLIE_*, NOWPAYMENTS_*, OPENPIX_*, PAYKU_*, PAYSTACK_*.
	‚Ä¢	Events: order.paid, payment.failed, crypto.txn.confirmed.
	‚Ä¢	Add to payments-settings for admin control.
	4.	Payments Settings (global) ‚Üí commerce-svc + admin-ui
	‚Ä¢	One control panel to enable/disable/test rails.
	‚Ä¢	Reflects in service discovery for commerce.
	5.	Pages ‚Üí cms-svc
	‚Ä¢	CRUD for static pages.
	‚Ä¢	Events: page.published, page.updated.
	6.	Role & Permissions ‚Üí users-svc
	‚Ä¢	Extend RBAC to fine-grained permissions.
	‚Ä¢	Events: role.assigned, permission.updated.

‚∏ª

‚ö° Bottom line: BoyFanz‚Äôs Sponzy v6.8 now has a compliance-grade moderation suite, RBAC system, and 10+ global payment processors beyond the usual suspects. In your polyglot OS, commerce-svc must become a multi-gateway orchestrator, and users-svc must enforce RBAC + reserved names.

Josh ‚Äî do you want me to sync all of this (moderation, RBAC, payments expansion, reserved names) into the migration canvas doc so Replit has the fully updated service/service-event/payment blueprint? That‚Äôll give you a single ‚Äúmaster playbook‚Äù covering every feature up to Sponzy v6.8.
