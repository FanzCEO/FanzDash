Got it — for an adult platform you’ll want a hybrid, multi‑signal moderation stack that covers live streams, VOD, images, and text, with machine checks first and human review on all edge cases. Here’s a zero‑cost-first plan that you can implement today.

What to use (free/open‑source first)

Images & video (nudity/sexual content)
	•	NudeNet (object & region detection) — flags exposed body parts and gives bounding boxes you can blur/blackout automatically. Runs on CPU/GPU and has Node/TFJS ports.  ￼
	•	LAION Safety / CLIP NSFW (fast NSFW classifier) — lightweight classifier using CLIP embeddings; good for quick triage or frame sampling on live streams.  ￼
	•	OpenNSFW2 (classic Yahoo model, Keras) — simple image/video classifier; good as a second opinion in an ensemble.  ￼
	•	PDQ perceptual hashing (Meta’s open algorithm) — generate hashes of known banned images and catch near‑duplicates at upload; Python bindings available. (Do not store illegal content; only store hashes).  ￼

Text (DMs, chats, comments, titles)
	•	Detoxify (open‑source toxicity model: toxicity, hate, insult, etc.).  ￼
	•	Perspective API (free quota; TOXICITY, SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT, INSULT, THREAT, etc.). Use as a second signal or fallback.  ￼

Audio in live/video
	•	Whisper (open ASR) to get captions, then run text moderation on the transcript. Keep a human‑in‑the‑loop because Whisper can hallucinate—especially in noisy streams.  ￼ ￼ ￼

Optional paid fallback (easy swap‑in)
	•	Google Video Intelligence (Explicit Content Detection) and AWS Rekognition Moderation APIs — useful as a belt‑and‑suspenders check or when your infra is overloaded.  ￼ ￼

How to wire it (reference architecture)

Flow A — Uploads (images & videos)
	1.	Pre‑ingest gate
	•	Compute PDQ hash → compare with your “blocked” hash set.
	•	If clean, run NudeNet (region detection). Auto‑blur/redact flagged regions server‑side.
	•	Run a secondary classifier (LAION Safety or OpenNSFW2) to raise/lowers confidence.
	2.	Decision
	•	Score merge (e.g., weighted average).
	•	> threshold → auto‑block or age‑gate. Borderline → human review queue. Clean → publish.
	3.	Store minimal metadata (scores, model versions, PDQ hash), not the content itself if it’s illegal.

Flow B — Live streaming
	1.	From your WebRTC SFU (Janus/Mediasoup/LiveKit), sample frames (e.g., 2–4 fps) + low‑bitrate audio.
	2.	Run NudeNet on frames, CLIP NSFW for quick triage. Escalate frame rate when scores spike.
	3.	Pipe audio through Whisper → Detoxify/Perspective on rolling transcript.
	4.	If risk > threshold → auto‑mask video (blur box/pixelate) or soft‑mute audio while pinging a human mod.
	5.	Keep a mod console that shows last N seconds of frames, bounding boxes, and transcript.

Flow C — Chats/DMs/comments
	•	Synchronous call to Detoxify (local) + Perspective (cloud) → action: allow, warn, shadow‑hide, or mod‑review.

Quickstart code (free stack)

1) Image PDQ hash + NudeNet (Python / FastAPI)

# requirements: fastapi uvicorn pillow pdqhash nudenet==3.5.2
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile
from PIL import Image
from pdqhash import pdqhash
from nudenet import NudeDetector

app = FastAPI()
detector = NudeDetector()  # downloads model on first run

BLOCKLIST = set(open("blocked_pdq_hashes.txt").read().splitlines())

@app.post("/moderate/image")
async def moderate_image(file: UploadFile):
    img = Image.open(file.file).convert("RGB")
    # PDQ hash check
    h, q = pdqhash(img)  # h is hash, q is quality
    if h in BLOCKLIST:
        return {"action":"block","reason":"hash_match","pdq_quality":q}

    # NudeNet detection
    results = detector.detect(img)  # [{'label':'EXPOSED_BREAST_F','score':0.93,'box':[x1,y1,x2,y2]}, ...]
    nudity_score = max([r["score"] for r in results], default=0.0)
    labels = [r["label"] for r in results]
    if nudity_score >= 0.85:
        return {"action":"blur","score":nudity_score,"labels":labels}
    elif nudity_score >= 0.60:
        return {"action":"review","score":nudity_score,"labels":labels}
    else:
        return {"action":"allow","score":nudity_score}

2) Live video frame sampling (FFmpeg → HTTP)

# Sample 3 fps from an RTMP/WebRTC restream and POST PNG frames to your API
ffmpeg -i rtmp://your-sfu/live/streamKey -vf fps=3 -f image2pipe -vcodec png - \
  | while IFS= read -r -d '' frame; do
      curl -s -X POST -F "file=@-" http://moderator.local/moderate/image
    done

3) Text moderation (Detoxify + optional Perspective)

# pip install detoxify requests
from detoxify import Detoxify
import requests, os

tox = Detoxify('original')  # or multilingual
PERSPECTIVE_KEY = os.getenv("PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY")

def score_text(txt):
    s = tox.predict(txt)  # {'toxicity':0.12,'insult':0.03,...}
    persp = {}
    if PERSPECTIVE_KEY:
        persp = requests.post(
          "https://commentanalyzer.googleapis.com/v1alpha1/comments:analyze",
          params={"key":PERSPECTIVE_KEY},
          json={"comment":{"text":txt},"requestedAttributes":{"TOXICITY":{},"SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT":{}}}
        ).json()
    return s, persp

Policies & safety you should enforce
	•	Zero tolerance for suspected CSAM: never store; immediately block, preserve minimal logs, and report to NCMEC (if US) per applicable law. Use PDQ (and industry hash lists where legally accessible) to catch re‑uploads.  ￼
	•	No automated “minor detection” approvals: age estimation is error‑prone; force human review whenever youth cues are detected, and require verified age of performers off‑platform.
	•	Appeals & auditability: log model version + thresholds per decision; give creators a path to appeal.
	•	Whisper caveat: transcripts can fabricate; never auto‑enforce severe actions from ASR alone without corroborating signals (vision or human).  ￼ ￼ ￼

Thresholds (starter defaults)
	•	Images/Video:
	•	>=0.85 (high confidence) → block or auto‑blur + review.
	•	0.60–0.85 → human review.
	•	<0.60 → allow.
	•	Text (Detoxify toxicity or Perspective TOXICITY):
	•	>=0.80 → block; 0.50–0.80 → warn or shadow‑hide + review; <0.50 → allow.

Deploy it for $0 (or close)
	•	Inference: host the FastAPI service on a small VM (your own server) or free credits; convert models to ONNX and run with ONNX Runtime for CPU if no GPU.
	•	Edge request firewall: Cloudflare Workers (free tier) as your public gateway; route uploads/frames/chats to your FastAPI.
	•	Queuing & bursts: Redis (free tier) or MQTT for jobs; fall back to Google Video Intelligence/AWS Rekognition when your node is saturated (bill only when burst happens).  ￼ ￼
	•	Dashboard: a minimal Next.js app showing frame thumbnails, bounding boxes, transcripts, and one‑click actions (allow/blur/ban).

How this scales
	•	Start with 1–4 fps frame sampling; dynamically raise to 8–12 fps only when risk spikes to conserve compute.
	•	Use batching: send frames in batches to the detector.
	•	Periodically re‑score popular uploads when models update.

If you want, I can package this as a plug‑and‑play repo (FastAPI service + Docker + example Next.js mod console), configured with NudeNet, LAION Safety, PDQ, Detoxify, and optional Perspective.
