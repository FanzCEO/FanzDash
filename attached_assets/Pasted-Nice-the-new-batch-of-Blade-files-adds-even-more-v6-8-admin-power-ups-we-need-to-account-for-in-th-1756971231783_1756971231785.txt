‚ö° Bottom line: Sponzy v6.8 isn‚Äôt just a Laravel script anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs evolved into a full creator economy control center, with ads, crypto, CCBill, comments, blogs, jobs, and analytics all baked in. For your polyglot rebuild, this means at least two new services (analytics-svc, ops-svc) and extending commerce-svc, policy-svc, and cms-svc.

Josh, do you want me to update the migration canvas doc with these new modules and service mappings (CCBill, Coinbase, CoinPayments, Charts, Cron, Comments, CSS-JS)? That way your Replit devs get the one-stop blueprint covering all v6.8 features.
